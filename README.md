Welcome to my personal site, I've made it myself using some cool tools like React's SSG [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and the awesome [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).
I'm also trying my best to make it look good considering I'm not a designer.

# TODO
There's still a lot to do though:
- Make it mobile friendly
- Improve it's look & feel
- Add a portfolio
- Create a contact form

But there is no rush, I'll keep working on it so, stay tuned!

I hope you like it.
